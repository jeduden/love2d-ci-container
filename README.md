# love2d-ci-container

A minimal Debian-based Docker container for running Love2D games in headless/CI environments without requiring a graphics card or audio card.

## Features

- üêß **Debian-based**: Built on `debian:bookworm-slim` for minimal size
- üéÆ **Headless Love2D**: Runs Love2D games without GPU/audio hardware using Xvfb
- üîß **Development tools**: Includes LuaJIT and Luarocks
- üì¶ **Minimal size**: Optimized for small container size
- üöÄ **CI/CD ready**: Perfect for automated testing and continuous integration
- üì∏ **Screenshot support**: Capture and extract screenshots for visual regression testing
- üé¨ **Video recording**: Record game execution as MP4 and animated GIF
- ü§ñ **Copilot integration**: Built-in instructions for automated visual PR reviews
- üîä **Audio testing**: Dummy audio driver for testing audio-enabled games

## Quick Start

### Pull from GitHub Container Registry

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/jeduden/love2d-ci-container:latest
```

### Run your Love2D game

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/your/game:/game ghcr.io/jeduden/love2d-ci-container:latest
```

The container expects your Love2D game to be mounted at `/game`.

## Building Locally

```bash
docker build -t love2d-ci:local .
```

## Testing

Run the included test game:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/test-game:/game love2d-ci:local
```

### Screenshots and Video

Capture screenshots and video recordings from your game for visual testing or documentation:

```bash
# Run game and extract screenshots in one command
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/your-game:/game \
  -v $(pwd)/screenshots:/output \
  ghcr.io/jeduden/love2d-ci-container:latest \
  /run-and-screenshot.sh

# Run game and record video (includes screenshots)
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/your-game:/game \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
  ghcr.io/jeduden/love2d-ci-container:latest \
  /run-and-record.sh
```

Your screenshots and video will be available in the output directory.

#### How to Use Screenshots in Your Game

In your Love2D game, save screenshots using `love.graphics.captureScreenshot`:

```lua
function love.draw()
    -- Your drawing code here
    love.graphics.print("Hello World", 10, 10)
    
    -- Capture screenshot (must be called from love.draw)
    if needScreenshot then
        love.graphics.captureScreenshot(function(imageData)
            local data = imageData:encode("png")
            love.filesystem.write("screenshots/my_screenshot.png", data)
            print("Screenshot saved!")
        end)
        needScreenshot = false
    end
end
```

Screenshots are saved to Love2D's save directory and can be extracted using the helper scripts.

#### Video Recording

The container includes ffmpeg for recording your game as it runs. The video recording:
- Captures the full game window at 30 FPS
- Outputs in MP4 format (H.264, compatible with GitHub)
- **Generates animated GIF** - Embedded directly in GitHub Actions Summary
- Records the actual visual output, perfect for PR reviews
- **GIF preview inline** - See the game in action without downloading
- Full video available in artifacts for detailed review

## Usage Examples

### In GitHub Actions

#### Basic Test

```yaml
jobs:
  test-game:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Test Love2D game
        run: |
          docker run --rm -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/game \
            ghcr.io/jeduden/love2d-ci-container:latest
```

#### With Video Recording and Screenshots

Capture video and screenshots, upload as artifacts:

```yaml
jobs:
  test-game:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run game and record video
        run: |
          mkdir -p output
          docker run --rm \
            -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/game \
            -v ${{ github.workspace }}/output:/output \
            ghcr.io/jeduden/love2d-ci-container:latest \
            /run-and-record.sh
      
      - name: Upload video and screenshots
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: game-recording
          path: output/
```

This captures both video (MP4) and screenshots (PNG) in one step.

This displays screenshots and audio test results directly in the GitHub Actions summary page.

#### Post Screenshots to PR (for Copilot/Agents)

Screenshots can be automatically posted to pull requests for review:

```yaml
jobs:
  test-game:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run game and capture screenshots
        run: |
          mkdir -p screenshots
          docker run --rm \
            -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/game \
            -v ${{ github.workspace }}/screenshots:/output \
            ghcr.io/jeduden/love2d-ci-container:latest \
            /run-and-screenshot.sh
      
      - name: Post screenshots to PR
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const files = fs.readdirSync('screenshots').filter(f => f.endsWith('.png'));
            if (files.length === 0) return;
            
            let comment = '## üéÆ Game Screenshots\n\n';
            for (const file of files) {
              const content = fs.readFileSync(`screenshots/${file}`);
              comment += `### ${file}\n![${file}](data:image/png;base64,${content.toString('base64')})\n\n`;
            }
            
            await github.rest.issues.createComment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              body: comment
            });
```

This workflow makes screenshots immediately visible to reviewers and AI agents like GitHub Copilot, enabling visual feedback on game changes.

## GitHub Copilot Integration

This repository includes comprehensive instructions for GitHub Copilot in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. These instructions guide Copilot to:

- üé¨ **Automatically capture video and animated GIFs** when reviewing Love2D game PRs
- üì∏ **Post screenshots inline** in PR comments for immediate visual feedback
- üéûÔ∏è **Embed animated GIFs** directly in PR reviews showing complete game execution
- üìù **Provide structured visual feedback** with observations and comparisons
- ü§ñ **Enable AI-powered visual review** without manual intervention

### For Copilot Agents

When GitHub Copilot reviews a PR with Love2D game changes, it will:

1. Run the container with `/run-and-record.sh` to capture video, GIF, and screenshots
2. Post the animated GIF inline in the PR comment for immediate visual feedback
3. Include individual screenshot images at key frames
4. Provide observations about visual behavior and rendering
5. Reference the full MP4 video in artifacts for detailed analysis

This enables comprehensive visual regression testing and automated PR reviews with rich visual context.

### Example Automated PR Comment

When Copilot reviews your PR, you'll see comments like:

```markdown
## üéÆ Love2D Game Test Results

I've tested the game changes using the Love2D CI container. Here's what I observed:

### Game Recording

![Game Recording](data:image/gif;base64,...)

The animated GIF shows the complete game execution (~3 seconds at 10 FPS).

### Key Observations

- Circle animation works smoothly with radius changing based on frame count
- Rectangles render correctly on left and right sides
- Text displays frame counter and test status properly
- No rendering glitches observed

### Screenshots at Key Frames

[Individual screenshots embedded inline]

Full quality MP4 video available in artifacts.
```

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for complete integration details.

### Running Luarocks

```bash
docker run --rm love2d-ci:local luarocks --version
```

### Running LuaJIT

```bash
docker run --rm love2d-ci:local luajit -v
```

## Advanced Usage

### Audio Testing

The container supports audio testing using SDL's dummy audio driver (SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy). Audio works out of the box without requiring actual audio hardware. Games can play sounds and music normally, output is just not heard.

### Manual Screenshot Extraction

If you've already run your game and want to extract screenshots separately:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/your-game:/game \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
  ghcr.io/jeduden/love2d-ci-container:latest \
  /extract-screenshots.sh
```

## Development

The container includes:
- Love2D game engine (version 11.4)
- LuaJIT for high-performance Lua execution
- Luarocks for Lua package management
- Xvfb for headless display
- PulseAudio with null sink for audio testing
- ImageMagick for image processing
